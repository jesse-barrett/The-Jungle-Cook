## Potential Issues
If the site isn't working at all, it might be an issue with deployment. I'm not very familiar with Firebase, but I think it might just take time to update the site after deploying.

Sometimes, when clicking on the "Browse" or "Your Recipes" links in the navbar, the page will load with no recipes visible on it. I haven't been able to figure out why it does this, but it can usually be fixed by clicing on a different link and then returning to the one you wanted in the first place.

If for some reason the account-creation feature is not working, you can use "jesselb1123@gmail.com" as the email and "password" as the password to log in.

I've been recieving emails from Firebase about the security of my project and that it might close my project down if I don't fix it. Hopefully I've got it fixed if you're reading this.

## Description
The Jungle Cook is a fully responsive CRUD application that allows a user to create, view, edit, and delete recipes. At this point in time, the only feature that is actually implimented is the ability to view recipes. That alone was an uphill battle for me, but I'm proud of my accomplishments even though they weren't as grand as I'd hoped. Users can also create new accounts and log in to the site. Data for recipes is stored locally on a JSON file. I'm not educated on how to use an external database without PHP, but I personally think that using a JSON did create some complications as far as picking and chosing the data I wanted across multiple pages.

## Reflection
I wasn't prepared for how tricky it was to implement the JSON data that I wanted when changing pages. For example, if I click on a recipe it routes me to the "view-recipe" page. My methods for displaying the correct recipe dynamically on that page is very inefficient in my opinion. 

I should have set aside more time to work out the CRUD operations. Given time, I'm sure I could make them work, I just didn't set aside that kind of time.

At the end of the day, this was an interesting project. I might continue to work on it in my free time.
